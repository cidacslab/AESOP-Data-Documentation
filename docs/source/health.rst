Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus) infection is an infection caused by a viral spread to humans (and/or other vertebrates) through the bite of a blood-feeding arthropods (eg. flies, mosquitoes, ticks, etc). There are more than 250 species of arbovirus, including dengue, Zika, chikungunya, West Nile, Yellow fever, and others.  An Arbovirus catalog is described `here <https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Arbocat/Default.aspx>`_.

For the purposes of the AESOP project, we collected data of suspected Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya infections that were reported and are available in the `Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN). <https://portalsinan.saude.gov.br>`_

Brazilian deprivation index (IBP)
--------------------------------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

It provides deprivation measures for each Brazilian municipality and census sector and is used to evaluate health inequalities across the country. The 2010 Brazilian Population Census is the basis for calculating the deprivation measure, available from CIDACS, [CIDACS,2020]_. 

The IBP index combines three factors: 

1 - the percentage of families with income per capita below half of the minimum wage; 
2 - the percentage of illiterate people older than 7 years old; 
3 - the percentage of people without adequate access to drinkable water, sewage, garbage collection, bathroom, or shower;

This data does not need to be updated and the complete documentation about the construction of the index is presented in Developing a small-area deprivation measure for Brazil: Technical report. The original data source and visualization can be found in Cidacs.

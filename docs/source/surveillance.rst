Respiratory infections
----------------------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

Acute Respiratory Infections are the third cause of mortality worldwide and are usually caused by virus or bacterial agents.

The influenza A(H1N1) pandemic of 2009 highlighted the importance of collecting information about disease severity in a standardized manner and having historical data available for countries to assess current influenza seasons in the context of previous ones (1). Thus, since 2009, notification of all hospitalized cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) is mandatory in Brazil. 

Data on hospitalized SARI cases are inserted and collated in a centralized system, the "Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe" (SIVEP-Gripe), which is under governance of the Ministry of Health (MoH).

Following the Covid-19 pandemic, mild Influenza-like illness cases started to be reported on e-SUS Vigilância Epidemiológica (e-SUS-VE), a new national COVID-19 reporting system, also centralized and ran by the MoH. Although currently in use, reporting of mild cases will probably be discontinued as mitigation of the public health emergency caused by Covid-19 goes on.
Both e-SUS-VE and SIVEP-Gripe include suspected and confirmed cases as reported by public health and private services, and case definitions for notification are:

* Hospitalized SARI cases:

A hospitalized patient presenting with the acute onset of fever and cough OR sore throat AND with one of the following: acute respiratory distress, dyspnea, or O2 saturation < 95%. Any patient with the above symptoms and died, regardless of hospitalization.

* Influenza-like illness mild cases:

Any patient presenting with the acute onset of fever (ut to 5 days) and cough OR sore throat.
All notified cases should go under laboratory investigation in order to ascertain the causative agent for confirming or discarding infectious diseases.


Arboviruses infections 
----------------------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus) infection is an infection caused by a viral spread to humans (and/or other vertebrates) through the bite of a blood-feeding arthropods (eg. flies, mosquitoes, ticks, etc). There are more than 250 species of arbovirus, including dengue, Zika, chikungunya, West Nile, Yellow fever, and others.  An Arbovirus catalog is described `here <https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Arbocat/Default.aspx>`_.

For the purposes of the AESOP project, we collected data of suspected Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya infections that were reported and are available in the `Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN). <https://portalsinan.saude.gov.br>`_. The notification of every suspected case of these 3 diseases is mandatory, and case definition are as follows:

**Dengue:** 

Suspect case:
Any patient residing in (or having traveled to in the previous 14 days), an area with dengue or Aedes aegypti occurrence, and who presents with acute onset of fever (lasting up to 7 days) and 2 or more of the following symptoms: nausea/vomiting, rash, myalgia/arthralgia, headache, retro-orbital pain, petechiae, positive tourniquete test, leukopenia

**Chikungunya**
Suspect case:
Any patient presenting with sudden onset of high fever (>38.5°C) and acute onset of arthralgia or severe arthritis not explained by other conditions, residing in (or having visited in the previous 14 days) areas with chikungunya transmission, or who has an epidemilogic link to a confirmed imported case

**Zika**
Suspect case:
Any patient presenting with pruritic maculopapular rash and one of the following: fever, conjunctival hyperaemia/non-purulent conjunctivitis, arthralgia/polyarthralgia, Periarticular edema.

In each disease, a patient will be assigned as a confirmed case of dengue, Zika or chinkungunya infection when a laboratory test (PCR, serology, virus isolation) is confirmed OR, when laboratory analysis is not possible, when the case is compatible with clinical presentation AND with epidemiologic link to a confirmed case AND for which no other diagnosis was confirmed.

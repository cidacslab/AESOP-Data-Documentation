Arboviruses infections 
----------------------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus) infection is an infection caused by a viral spread to humans (and/or other vertebrates) through the bite of a blood-feeding arthropods (eg. flies, mosquitoes, ticks, etc). There are more than 250 species of arbovirus, including dengue, Zika, chikungunya, West Nile, Yellow fever, and others.  An Arbovirus catalog is described `here <https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Arbocat/Default.aspx>`_.

For the purposes of the AESOP project, we collected data of suspected Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya infections that were reported and are available in the `Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN). <https://portalsinan.saude.gov.br>`_. The notification of every suspected case of these 3 diseases is mandatory, and case definition are as follows:

**Dengue:** 

Suspect case:
Any patient residing in (or having traveled to in the previous 14 days), an area with dengue or Aedes aegypti occurrence, and who presents with acute onset of fever (lasting up to 7 days) and 2 or more of the following symptoms: nausea/vomiting, rash, myalgia/arthralgia, headache, retro-orbital pain, petechiae, positive tourniquete test, leukopenia

**Chikungunya**
Suspect case:
Any patient presenting with sudden onset of high fever (>38.5Â°C) and acute onset of arthralgia or severe arthritis not explained by other conditions, residing in (or having visited in the previous 14 days) areas with chikungunya transmission, or who has an epidemilogic link to a confirmed imported case

**Zika**
Suspect case:
Any patient presenting with pruritic maculopapular rash and one of the following: fever, conjunctival hyperaemia/non-purulent conjunctivitis, arthralgia/polyarthralgia, Periarticular edema.

In each disease, a patient will be assigned as a confirmed case of dengue, Zika or chinkungunya infection when a laboratory test (PCR, serology, virus isolation) is confirmed OR, when laboratory analysis is not possible, when the case is compatible with clinical presentation AND with epidemiologic link to a confirmed case AND for which no other diagnosis was confirmed.

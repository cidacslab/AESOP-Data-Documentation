Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
From a health point of view, meteorological factors influencing human health have been given greater prominence by the need to better understand the effects of urban environmental changes on population health and possible vulnerabilities to climate variability scenarios. Conducting research in urban biometeorology has been pointed out as an important area of study to understand the relationships between climate and health in cities, to understand both the processes that can trigger diseases and those that create healthy environments. Therefore, the study of the relations between climate and human health, especially from the perspective of global climate change, to predict its likely effects on the health of the population and vulnerabilities to these changes, becomes relevant.

Biometeorological studies are not limited by physical or temporal scales, nor by the intensity of the atmospheric signal, which can vary from small local random variability to extreme events such as tropical cyclones, extreme ultraviolet radiation and thermal hazards. Clearly, within these broad limits, biometeorology lends itself naturally to interdisciplinary research and collaboration, involving areas such as medicine, biology, sociology, social policies, etc.

Biometeorology is related to an infinite number of geographical scales. For example, a large-scale study would be the impact of climate change on human well-being. Or on a micro-scale: an investigation of the effects of temperature change on the spread of vectors of tropical diseases.

All of these aspects are associated with the understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of climatic, meteorological, environmental and geographical variables for the region of interest. Such information provides support for the understanding of potential relationships between the variables mentioned and the spatial and temporal evolution of epidemics. Such understanding will be determined from the acquisition of observational data and the execution of regional atmospheric computational models. The observational data to be used come from local sensors (eg, weather stations) and remote data from sensors fixed to satellites. It is important to emphasize the use of regional atmospheric modelling to cover potential blanks on the available climate database and the possibility of guaranteeing consistent space and time variables distribution for the study region. 

The meteorological and weather parameters could influence the infection rate and disease spread via various channels. For instance, the temperature level, pressure, winds, humidity, or air quality might increase or decrease the transmission rate, risk, and survival period of the virus in the air or on surfaces. Additionally, extreme weather or long-term meteorological events, such as heat waves or severe storms, that cause persistent conditions for several days, can increase the risk of respiratory disease transmission through various mechanisms, including displacement of populations, disruption of healthcare systems, and increased exposure to pollutants. Overall, while climate is not the sole determinant of respiratory disease transmission, it is certainly one of many factors that can play a role.


Data access information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The analysis of the information will be based on the creation of a data acquisition system integrated with a database of historical and spatial series. The implementation of the database will come from:

 ✔ local weather stations owned by the proponent Institutions, as well as partnerships established with municipal, state and federal government agencies;
 ✔ orbital/satellite sensors (optical and SAR): use of existing infrastructure to receive data in real-time covering the national territory and involving meteorological, oceanographic and ground cover information.


The above data are related to past analysis and real-time observation of the present moment and involve primary variables such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, solar radiation, etc. Associated with this information will be integrated into the database information on short, medium and long-term forecasts using computational modelling methodologies/environmental mathematics. The generation of physical fields from computational modelling will also allow the reconstruction of historical series and the absence of spatial and temporal data, the reconstruction of local and specific physical data fields, and past scenarios in regions without available data. Due to the different sampling characteristics of each data source, the information to be acquired and integrated will undergo pre-processing to standardize the representativeness and distribution. The spatial and temporal sampling will be standardized with the objective of correlating and comparing with variables from other sources within the context of the project, such as those related to the clinic.

Description

From a health point of view, meteorological factors influencing human health have been given greater prominence by the need to better understand the effects of urban environmental changes on population health and possible vulnerabilities to climate variability scenarios. Conducting research in urban biometeorology has been pointed out as an important area of study to understand the relationships between climate and health in cities, in order to understand both the processes that can trigger diseases and those that create healthy environments. Therefore, the study of the relations between climate and human health, especially from the perspective of global climate change, in order to predict its likely effects on the health of the population and vulnerabilities to these changes, becomes relevant. 

Biometeorological studies are not limited by physical or temporal scales, nor by the intensity of the atmospheric signal, which can vary from small local random variability to extreme events such as tropical cyclones, extreme ultraviolet radiation and thermal hazards. Clearly, within these broad limits, biometeorology lends itself naturally to interdisciplinary research and collaboration, involving areas such as medicine, biology, sociology, social policies, etc. 

Biometeorology is related to an infinite number of geographical scales. For example, a large-scale study would be the impact of climate change on human well-being. Or on a micro scale: an investigation of the effects of temperature change on the spread of vectors of tropical diseases. 

All of these aspects are associated with the understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of climatic, meteorological, environmental and geographical variables for the region of interest. Such information provides support for the understanding of potential relationships between the variables mentioned and the spatial and temporal evolution of epidemics. Such understanding will be determined from the acquisition of observational data and the execution of regional atmospheric computational models. The observational data to be used come from local sensors (eg, weather stations) and remote data from sensors fixed to satellites. It is important to emphasize the use of regional atmospheric modeling in order to cover potential blanks on the available climate data base and the possibility to guarantee consistent space and time variables distribution for the study region. The meteorological and weather parameters could influence the infection rate and disease spread via various channels. For instance, the temperature level, pressure, winds, humidity, or air quality might increase or decrease the transmission rate, risk, and survival period of the virus in the air or on surfaces. Another factor, The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) is a complex meteorological index derived from an analysis of human thermal balance that depends on air temperature, air humidity, and wind speed. Hence, the significance and sensitivity analysis of meteorological parameters on virus's infection rate is essential. So, other information to be used in the epidemiological models used is related to the spatial and temporal distribution of meteorological variables and indexes, which will provide relevant information for a better understanding of the diffusion of pathogens and human vulnerability to a given SRAG. 

Data access information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data integration based on meteorological data acquisition, environmental modelling and socioeconomic modelling, using Artificial Intelligent and Machine Learning techniques. 

Data Acquisition:
 Local weather stations: currently existing data inventory
 Satellite data (optical and SAR): meteorological and air quality data

Need to assess the representativeness of these data and spatial distribution; Indexes and empirical parameterizations;

Environmental modeling:

	* Spatially and temporally distributed data;	
	* Reconstruction of historical series and absence of spatial and temporal data;
	* Reconstruction of local and specific physical data fields;
	* Objective analysis and deep learning;
	* Data assimilation and reanalysis;
	* Past scenarios in regions with no data available.


Data-specific information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	1. The quality of these data sources should be checked, standardized and standardized;
	2.	Just as importantly, Meteorological and Air Quality (MAQ) data should be applied at an appropriate spatial scale for satellite analysis;
	3.	The use of single stations or national averages, for example, may be problematic when analyzing remote patterns in spatially extensive or climatically diverse regions (including strong land-sea differences, orography, urban-rural contrasts, etc.);
	4.	MAQ data should generally be reconciled with remote data at the best spatial scale for which both forms of data are considered reliable.


All data will be stored in the AESOP HPC facility, and the raw sequences data will be held in other servers in Fiocruz. All the codes to perform the bioinformatics analysis, including the pipeline implementation, the statistical analysis, and the data visualization, will be maintained in the AESOP GitHub repository.


Limitations of Environmental dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spatial and temporal in-situ data coverage. Modelling and Orbital data will fill out these gaps.
